Public codes for "Calibration of Spatio-Temporal Forecasts from Citizen Science Urban Air Pollution Data with Sparse Recurrent Neural Networks" by Matthew Bonas and Stefano Castruccio

## Data
Dataset "SimulatedData.RData" with 10 variables (locations) and 500 time points. This data is to be used in conjunction with the R scripts.

## functions.R
R script containing the user created functions used in calibration.R. This script does not need to be run manually for the other files automatically import the functions from this file.

## calibration.R
R script containing the code and methods used to calibrate the forecasts from the ESN. This script corresponds to Algorithm 1.
